### About Me & Goals
When I first stepped into the world of technology, I was fascinated by how much trust organizations place in their systems—and how much is at stake if those systems fail. That curiosity quickly grew into a passion for IT audit, risk management, and cybersecurity.

I’m currently a Computer Information Systems and Technology student at The University of Texas at Dallas (graduating in 2025) and hold a CompTIA A+ certification. Recently, I had the opportunity to work as an IT Audit Intern at Lennox International, where I gained hands-on experience with SOX compliance testing, AI governance assessments, and control evaluations. These experiences sharpened my skills in IT governance, compliance frameworks, and risk assessment—and confirmed my goal to specialize in IT audit.

I’m now working toward my Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) and Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) credentials, with the mission of helping organizations strengthen technology controls, ensure regulatory compliance, and protect data integrity.

Whether it’s testing controls, assessing risk, or exploring the governance challenges of emerging technologies like AI, I’m committed to turning complex problems into actionable solutions.

## Projects

### SOX Compliance: IT Application Controls (ITACs) Testing (Summer 2025)
During my internship at Lennox International, I contributed to SOX compliance efforts by testing IT Application Controls (ITACs) across key systems. Using standardized audit workpapers, I:
- Reviewed system configurations and control documentation.
- Performed walkthroughs with control owners to understand control logic.
- Validated control effectiveness through sample testing and screenshot evidence.
- This project strengthened my understanding of regulatory compliance, control design, and documentation best practices while sharpening my attention to detail in audit processes.

### AI Governance Assessment (Summer 2025)
I supported the early stages of Lennox International’s AI governance audit planning, focusing on risk identification, scope definition, and framework exploration. My contributions included:
- Researching AI governance best practices from NIST and industry guidelines.
- Assessing AI use cases within the organization for risk and compliance implications.
- Helping draft a planning memo to outline the audit’s objectives, scope, and methodology.
- Identifying key risks related to AI adoption, such as data bias, model transparency, and regulatory alignment.
This project provided exposure to emerging technology governance, allowing me to combine audit skills with an understanding of responsible AI deployment.

### Laptop Replacement Project (Summer 2024)

During my internship with The Beck Group, using **Microsoft Sharepoint, Excel, PDQ Deploy, PDQ Inventory, Active Directory, and Windows RDP**, I replaced over 80 outdated computers, ensuring each user had a fully functional and correctly configured device. This project enhanced my laptop imaging and configuration skills and underscored the importance of careful planning and execution in large-scale IT operations.

### Broadcast Storm (Summer 2024)
At The Beck Group, we encountered a challenging situation where one of our network-connected TVs caused a broadcast storm, affecting internet connectivity for everyone on the AT&T job site. Initially, it was unclear what was causing the network congestion, so my manager and I systematically isolated each device connected to the network switch. After identifying the TV as the source, we unplugged it, immediately restoring connectivity.
To prevent this issue from recurring, I researched potential causes of broadcast storms and preventative measures to ensure that similar devices wouldn’t cause disruptions. Some preventative measures include creating VLANs to isolate network traffic, enabling storm control on switches to limit excessive broadcast traffic, testing devices for compatibility before deployment, scheduling regular firmware updates, and establishing real-time network monitoring to detect anomalies early, all of which ensure a more reliable and secure network environment.

### Recycling Laptop Project (Summer 2024)

Additionally, during my internship with The Beck Group, I managed the recycling of 200 outdated computers, ensuring data security at each stage. I used Dell's BIOS wipe feature for standard devices, deployed **DBAN** for older models, and physically destroyed hard drives in legacy systems. This process required close collaboration with our IT Coordinator and precise scheduling with a recycling company to arrange timely pickups, ensuring efficient disposal while safeguarding company data.

### Data Visualization Project (Spring 2024)
I gathered Apple Inc.'s stock data (high, low, and closing prices) from **Yahoo Finance** over the past 30 days. After collecting the data, I imported it into **Excel**, creating a **high-low-close candlestick chart** to illustrate the stock’s daily fluctuations and closing values.
The visualization effectively shows trends over time, such as periods of stability, volatility, and gradual shifts in stock prices. My main takeaway was observing the periods when Apple's stock experienced a consistent decrease, which could indicate market responses to specific events or broader economic conditions. This data collection and visualization exercise helped me better understand how to interpret stock market trends and utilize Excel for financial data analysis.
