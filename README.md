[Video Introduction](https://youtu.be/kB8LuGkBrv8)
### About Me
Hello! I’m Kenny Tran, a Computer Information Systems and Technology student at The University of Texas at Dallas, graduating in 2026. With a focus on Cybersecurity Management, I’m committed to building a strong foundation for a career in IT and cybersecurity. I hold a CompTIA A+ certification and am advancing my expertise by working toward Network+, Security+, AZ900, and Splunk Core certifications.

In my recent IT Help Desk internship at The Beck Group, I managed help desk tickets, resolved hardware, software, and network issues, and enhanced operational efficiency. I was entrusted with conducting the onboarding process for new hires by configuring their laptops and software, and equally as important, I led efforts to replace outdated systems, upgraded over 80 computers, and securely recycled over 260 laptops. One of my key takeaways from this experience was handling a broadcast storm at the AT&T job site: I learned the importance of adaptability and translating my formal education into practical solutions. 

Before joining The Beck Group, I served as an Apple Support College Program At Home Advisor, specializing in troubleshooting for iOS and macOS. I achieved a 100% customer satisfaction score, reflecting my dedication to quality service and technical problem-solving.

I aim to specialize in cybersecurity or IT audit, contributing to protecting sensitive data in dynamic, high-stakes environments. I am passionate about technology and constantly expanding my knowledge in coding and cybersecurity practices. In my spare time, I enjoy writing articles on cybersecurity trends and exploring new tech innovations, and I am dedicated to making a lasting impact in the tech field.

## Projects
### Laptop Replacement Project

During my internship with The Beck Group, using **Microsoft Sharepoint, Excel, PDQ Deploy, PDQ Inventory, Active Directory, and Windows RDP**, I replaced over 80 outdated computers, ensuring each user had a fully functional and correctly configured device. This project enhanced my laptop imaging and configuration skills and underscored the importance of careful planning and execution in large-scale IT operations.

### Recycling Laptop Project

Additionally, during my internship with The Beck Group, I managed the recycling of 200 outdated computers, ensuring data security at each stage. I used Dell's BIOS wipe feature for standard devices, deployed **DBAN** for older models, and physically destroyed hard drives in legacy systems. This process required close collaboration with our IT Coordinator and precise scheduling with a recycling company to arrange timely pickups, ensuring efficient disposal while safeguarding company data.

### Data Visualization Project
I gathered Apple Inc.'s stock data (high, low, and closing prices) from **Yahoo Finance** over the past 30 days. After collecting the data, I imported it into **Excel**, creating a **high-low-close candlestick chart** to illustrate the stock’s daily fluctuations and closing values.
The visualization effectively shows trends over time, such as periods of stability, volatility, and gradual shifts in stock prices. My main takeaway was observing the periods when Apple's stock experienced a consistent decrease, which could indicate market responses to specific events or broader economic conditions. This data collection and visualization exercise helped me better understand how to interpret stock market trends and utilize Excel for financial data analysis.

### Broadcast Storm
At The Beck Group, we encountered a challenging situation where one of our network-connected TVs caused a broadcast storm, affecting internet connectivity for everyone on the AT&T job site. Initially, it was unclear what was causing the network congestion, so my manager and I systematically isolated each device connected to the network switch. After identifying the TV as the source, we unplugged it, immediately restoring connectivity.
To prevent this issue from recurring, I researched potential causes of broadcast storms and preventative measures to ensure that similar devices wouldn’t cause disruptions. Some preventative measures include creating VLANs to isolate network traffic, enabling storm control on switches to limit excessive broadcast traffic, testing devices for compatibility before deployment, scheduling regular firmware updates, and establishing real-time network monitoring to detect anomalies early, all of which ensure a more reliable and secure network environment.
