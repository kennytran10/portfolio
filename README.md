# CompTIA A+ Certified | Cybersecurity & IT Audit Enthusiast

### About Me
Hello! I’m Kenny Tran, a Computer Information Systems and Technology student at the University of Texas at Dallas, graduating in 2026. With a focus on Cybersecurity Management, I’m committed to building a strong foundation for a career in IT and cybersecurity. Currently, I hold a CompTIA A+ certification and am advancing my expertise by working toward Network+, Security+, AZ900, and Splunk Core certifications.

In my recent IT Help Desk internship at The Beck Group, I gained practical experience managing help desk tickets, resolving hardware, software, and network issues, and enhancing operational efficiency. I took on a key role in onboarding by configuring laptops and software for new hires and led efforts to replace outdated systems, upgrading over 80 computers and securely recycling 260+ laptops. My problem-solving skills were tested and strengthened, especially when I quickly resolved a critical network issue caused by a broadcast storm, ensuring uninterrupted service for my team.

Before joining The Beck Group, I served as an Apple Support College Program At Home Advisor, specializing in troubleshooting for iOS and macOS. Here, I achieved a 100% customer satisfaction score, reflecting my dedication to quality service and technical problem-solving.

Looking forward, my goal is to specialize in cybersecurity or IT audit, contributing to protecting sensitive data in dynamic, high-stakes environments. I am passionate about technology and constantly expanding my knowledge in coding and cybersecurity practices. In my spare time, I enjoy writing articles on cybersecurity trends and exploring new tech innovations, and I am dedicated to making a lasting impact in the tech field.

During my internship with The Beck Group, using **Microsoft Sharepoint, Excel, PDQ Deploy, PDQ Inventory, Active Directory, and Windows RDP**, I replaced over 80 outdated computers, ensuring each user had a fully functional and correctly configured device. This project enhanced my laptop imaging and configuration skills and underscored the importance of careful planning and execution in large-scale IT operations.

### Recycling Laptop Project

Additionally, during my internship with The Beck Group, I managed the recycling of 200 outdated computers, ensuring data security at each stage. I used Dell's BIOS wipe feature for standard devices, deployed **DBAN** for older models, and physically destroyed hard drives in legacy systems. This process required close collaboration with our IT Coordinator and precise scheduling with a recycling company to arrange timely pickups, ensuring efficient disposal while safeguarding company data.
